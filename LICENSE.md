## Disclaimer

I don't claim this software is good for anything. If you think it is, cool. If it doesn't work, that's too bad.
If you lose a million because it crashes, it's you that loses a million, not I. If you don't like this disclaimer, that's too bad.
I reserve the right to do the absolute minimum provided by law, up to and including absolutely nothing.
This is basically the same disclaimer that comes with all software packages
but this one is written in plain English, theirs is written in Leµgalesµe and BaffleGab.
I didn't want to include any disclaimer at all, but lawyers showed up and insisted.
I tried to ignore them but they threatened me with the License Agreement Ninjas (see license agreement below).

## License Agreement

You are a criminal for even thinking about using this software.
The License Agreement Ninjas have been notified and are on their way.
